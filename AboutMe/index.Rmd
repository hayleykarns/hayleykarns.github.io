Hi there, my name is Hayley! I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science with a Major in Geology, a Minor in Outdoor Recreation, and a certificate in Geographic Information Systems

I'm a student researcher, currently working on two research projects. I am investigating crystal-plastic deformation of granite on the Wasatch fault, and I am also doing a research project in collaboration with the UGS to create a rock glacier database of Utah. 

Here is my CV!

When I'm not looking at rocks or using GIS, you can find me hiking, climbing, and snowboarding the Wasatch! I also enjoy weightlifting, running, and reading.

Hi there, my name is Hayley! I am pursuing a Bachelors of Science with a Major in Geology, a Minor in Outdoor Recreation, and a certificate in Geographic Information Systems. I'm a student researcher, currently working on two research projects. I am investigating crystal-plastic deformation of granite on the Wasatch fault, and I am also doing a research project in collaboration with the UGS to create a rock glacier database of Utah. 

When I'm not looking at rocks in the lab or using GIS, you can find me hiking, climbing, and snowboarding the Wasatch! I also enjoy weightlifting, running, and reading. 

Here is my CV and my resume.
